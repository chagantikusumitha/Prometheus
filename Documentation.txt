Issues Faced


Issue_1 : CrashLoopBackOff
This error occured while creating pods.
Which shows there is an error in the syntax of the yaml files.
I have corrected all the syntaxes,indentations and ran deployment files again.
Then the error is solved.

Issue_2 : InvalidImageName
This error is figured out when I tried checking pods for deployments I created.
Then I have checked the logs of pods using command 
kubectl logs <pod name>
Then I have changed the image name and tried pulling the image using docker first and then tried deploying again.
Then all the pods were ready.

Issue_3 : Invalid Credentials for grafana website.
Initially I have created values.yaml file also.
Then when I have tried using the values I have given in the values.yaml but it has shown invalid credentials.
So, I have just deleted values.yaml file and tried the website using default credentials like admin username and admin password, then it worked.

Issue_4 : SVC_NOT_FOUND
I have got an error stating Exiting due to SVC_NOT_FOUND: Service 'grafana' was not found in 'default' namespace. You may select another namespace by using 'minikube service grafana -n <namespace>'. Or list out all the services using 'minikube service list'.
Then I have solved it using following command:
kubectl get namespaces
minikube service grafana -n <namespace>
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get services
